# Project information
PROJECT_INFO = """
Project Title: Machine Learning Prediction based model for food insecurity forecasting
Dataset: FAO SDG 2.1.1 dataset tracking % of population undernourished from 2001 to 2022
Countries: India, Nigeria, and Brazil
Models Implemented: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, Random Forest, LSTM
Training Period: 2001-2016
Testing Period: 2017-2022
Key Findings:
- Random Forest performed best for Nigeria (MAE: 3.31)
- Random Forest performed best for India (MAE: 1.34)
- ARIMA, SARIMA and Prophet models performed equally well for Brazil (MAE: 0.57)
- Most models failed to predict the COVID-19 related rise in undernourishment
- All models had negative RÂ² values showing the difficulty in forecasting during unprecedented events

    "India": "India's undernourishment levels rose from 10.3% in 2018 to 14.0% in 2021, with Random Forest and LSTM models performing best.",
    "Brazil": "Brazil had historically low undernourishment (2.5%) which suddenly increased to 4.2% in 2021. All models predicted the same constant value of 2.5%, leading to identical performance metrics for some models."
